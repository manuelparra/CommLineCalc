# CommLineCalc

This is a C program for emulate a calculator in the command line, here I used stacks and tails, prefixes and postfixes to operand groups and apply precedence of operators

For used this program you need to compile and execute. next you put into the promp something like: 2 * (42/4) + 24 + (45*22/4)
